# Art-Generation-with-AI

## Project Overview

In recent years, art-creating AI has pushed the boundaries of how we define art. This competition challenges the African AI & Data Science community on Zindi to create original artwork and music track(s) using AI.

In this project, I built a neural style transfer that create paintwork of Messi using the style of Da vinci famous art monalisa.

Neural style transfer (NST) is a very neat idea. NST builds on the key idea that,it is possible to separate the style representation and content representations in a CNN, learnt during a computer vision task (e.g. image recognition task). Following this concept, NST employs a pretrained convolution neural network (CNN) to transfer styles from a given image to another. This is done by defining a loss function that tries to minimise the differences between a content image, a style image and a generated image.

## Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

## Google COlab(Optional)

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with

> - Zero configuration required
> - Free access to GPUs
> - Easy sharing

## Install

> - Python 3
> - NumPy
> - TensorFlow 1.x
> - Keras 2.x
